# Battleship
Ironhack [July2022PTWD] Project #1: partner project game design

The classic Battleship game playable in the browser as a simple 2 player game. Developed as a partner project with fellow classmate [Zequi Aguirre](https://github.com/Zequi-Aguirre). Project requirements: win/lose logic, a method of displaying game info or other feedback, vanilla HTML/CSS/JS, employ OOP and classes. Inspiration for the monsterverse theme came from [Blunt Brothers Productions](https://www.youtube.com/@BluntBrothersProductions).

## How to play

1. There are 7 ships automatically and randomly hidden on the grid positioned vertically and horizontally.
2. Each ship has a total length of between 2 and 5 consecutive circles.
3. Click on the circles to guess where the ships are located.
4. To sink a ship you have to click all of that ship's circles.
5. The message display above the grid will notify via text the result of each click (i.e. hit or miss, and when you have sunk a ship). The display will update with each click.
6. The player that can sink all their battleships in the fewest attempts wins the game.
7. When player 1 has finished, a modal will display the result and promt for player 2 to begin when ready. After player 2 has finished, a game summary modal will appear.

Best experience is with 15 inch screens and above. You might need to zoom out a bit with 14 inch screens. Definately not optimized for mobile devices.
